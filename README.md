# iCraft, the smartphone mod #

It's a mod that adds smartphones to Minecraft. Do I need to say more? Well, you can use it to browse thought the internet, call your friends, listen to mp3 music, buy items in-game or even buy a pizza(but don't forget to pay).

This is an open source project, the code here is all yours, do whatever you want with it. Thinking about using the mod in your public/personal/idontknow modpack? Just do it! Go ahead and be happy :)

Thanks to all the people who have contributed to this project, directly or indirectly. And thanks to Aidan Brady for the Voice Chat code(I took it from Mekanism), I don't think I could do it by myself. Thank you.
